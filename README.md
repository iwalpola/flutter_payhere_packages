# Flutter Payhere Packages
### Multiplatform packages for payhere SDKs ###

## note to developers ##
I have modified the payhere_mobilesdk_flutter to be async, and the platform interface also currently treats startPayment()
as an async function.

"payhere_mobilesdk_flutter" folder has also been renamed to "flutter_payhere". It would be better if it is imported into this project as a git submodule from your official repository.
